A side project I started as I was too excited to get started with our scrum project, [MSU-Students/student-advising-portal](https://github.com/MSU-Students/student-advising-portal).

## Development

Make sure `firebase-tools` is installed on your machine with:

```bash
npm i -g firebase-tools
```

And have your Firebase emulators started with:

```bash
firebase emulators:start
```

Then set your environment variable to development in order to use the emulators instead of the servers:

```bash
set NODE_ENV "development"
```

And blast off!

```bash
npm run dev
# or
quasar dev
```
